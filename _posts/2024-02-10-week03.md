## Learning Git
 
In class today, we did a git excersise where we forked a repository, and practiced adding, commiting, pushing, and merging using git. Overall, the excersize was a good way to refresh and reinforce my prior knowledge with git. It was a little confusing, becuase some people ran into issues and errors while others did not, but the general ideas were conveyed nicely.

## Browser Extension Experience

For the Browser Extension activity where we make our own Open Source Firefox extension, we decided to make an extension that finds and replaces a word. From my perspective, our team works very well. Every member has put in and demonstrated effort in building our web extension together. Becuase it is a relatively small extension, a potential downside is that there is not much code to write to split up tasks evenly. 

There was a lot of collaborative work, so it is hard to pinpoint my individual biggest contribution, but I would say it would be fixing an error that we had. One issue we ran into when making our extension was that our find and replace function only worked once, then returned an error if we tried to run it multiple times on one webpage. However this was solved by finding a bug in the code where we defined a function variable, and fixed it so that it was not recast every time we run our extension.
